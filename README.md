## Installation Steps ‚¨áÔ∏è

This project does **not** provide a detailed guide for installing macOS, you may need [related informations](#acknowledgments-üëè) for help. Instead, it provides a prebuilt EFI folder that can be used to boot macOS on your MateBook 14 2019. You will need to modify the `EFI/OC/config.plist`, prepare the macOS installer, configure your BIOS/UEFI settings yourself.
